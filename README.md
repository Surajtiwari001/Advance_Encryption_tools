**COMPANY** : CODTECH IT-SOLUTION

This Python script provides basic file encryption and decryption functionality using the Fernet library.  It generates a symmetric encryption key and uses it to encrypt and decrypt files.

**WARNING:** This script is for educational purposes only and demonstrates basic encryption concepts.  It is **not secure enough for production use** due to its simple key management.  For real-world applications, use a robust Key Management System (KMS) and follow security best practices.  **Never use passwords directly for encryption.**

## Features

* Generates a strong encryption key using `Fernet.generate_key()`.
* Stores the key in a file named `secret.key`.  **In a real application, use a secure KMS.**
* Encrypts files using the generated key.
* Decrypts files using the same key.
* Handles command-line arguments for encrypting or decrypting files.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python fileencrypt.py [encrypt/decrypt] [filename] [password]
    ```

    *   `encrypt`: Encrypts the specified file.
    *   `decrypt`: Decrypts the specified file.
    *   `filename`: The path to the file to encrypt or decrypt.
    *   `password`:  **This argument is currently a placeholder and is not used for encryption.**  See the important security note below.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    python fileencrypt.py encrypt my_secret_document.txt mypassword
    python fileencrypt.py decrypt my_secret_document.txt.encrypted mypassword
    ```

## Security Notes (Important)

*   **Key Management:** The `secret.key` file is currently stored in the same directory as the script. This is **not secure** for production environments.  Use a proper KMS for real applications.
*   **Password Handling:** The `password` argument is currently a placeholder and is **not used for encryption**.  **Never use passwords directly for encryption.**  Use a Key Derivation Function (KDF) like PBKDF2 to derive an encryption key from a password securely.
*   **This script is for educational purposes only.**  Do not use it for encrypting sensitive data in a real-world application without consulting with a security expert and implementing proper security measures.

## Dependencies

*   `cryptography` library:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## Future Improvements

*   Implement proper key derivation from a password using a KDF.
*   Integrate with a secure Key Management System (KMS).
*   Add more robust error handling.
*   Improve security by following best practices for encryption and key management.
